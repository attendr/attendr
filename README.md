# Deploying the App


## Backend Code

* Clone the sub-repository of the backend code.

* Run the app on a VPS or a server using ```python3 app.py```

* Deploy the code to a public IP or a URL for the app to use.


## Android app

* Clone the sub-repository of the android app. Change the occurence of the backend URL to the one that you'd like (where you've deployed your backend code).

* Compile and build the app using Android Studio.

* Enjoy
